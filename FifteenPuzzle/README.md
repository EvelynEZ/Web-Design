The Fifteen Puzzle (also called the Sliding Puzzle) is a simple classic game consisting of a 4x4 grid of numbered squares with one square missing. The object of the game is to arrange the tiles into numerical order by repeatedly sliding a square that neighbors the missing square into its empty space.
