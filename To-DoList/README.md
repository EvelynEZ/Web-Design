This project provides a web application for an online to-do list. 
The "Remember the Cow" site is a parody of the real to-do list web site "Remember the Milk". The site requires the user to log in or create an account first. After logging in, the user can manipulate his/her to-do list by adding or deleting items. Any changes made to the list are
saved to the web server, so that if the user leaves the page and returns later, the state of the list is remembered.
